      <h1>About the Developer</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Sophie Carr and I am a software development student from Richmond, Virginia. I have a background in fine arts, graduating from Henrico Highschool's Center for the Arts in 2015 and attending the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts for illustration shortly after. I am interested in creative front end design and graphic design and would possibly like to get involved with game development as well.
