  ## Description
  
  In this assignment I was instructed to create a static portfolio website using React. Using React components I was able to make a single page website that the user can navigate without the page refreshing. Each component, including the header and footer, contains HTML that is dynamically rendered to the page. Styling is also applied to the page by importing the style.css file to the React App file. This assignment helped me to better understand how to use React components and how they interact with each other.
